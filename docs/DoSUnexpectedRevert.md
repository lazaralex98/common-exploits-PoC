# Solidity API

## SimpleAuction

### currentLeader

```solidity
address currentLeader
```

address of the current leader of the auction

### highestBid

```solidity
uint256 highestBid
```

highest bid so far

### bid

```solidity
function bid() public payable
```

Bid on the auction with the value sent together with this transaction.
The old auction leader will receive his ETH back.
To fix use a 'pull payment system'.

## AuctionDoSAttacker

The attacker blocks anyone from bidding after him through a DoS attack.
This allows the attacker to safely win the auction.

### target

```solidity
contract SimpleAuction target
```

An interface to the target that will allow us to call its functions.

### constructor

```solidity
constructor(address _target) public
```

Set the target on deployment because we need it in storage
to be able to call it from the receive function.

### bid

```solidity
function bid() public payable
```

Bid on the auction with the value sent together with this transaction.
This contract will be the new auction leader if the transaction is successful.

### receive

```solidity
receive() external payable
```

This is called when the target contract sends ETH to this contract.
Whenever the auction tries to refund us, we will revert the transaction
and thus prevent any new bids from being made.

## CrowdFunding

### funders

```solidity
address[] funders
```

Addresses of all fund contributors

### funds

```solidity
mapping(address => uint256) funds
```

How much each address has contributed to the fund

### owner

```solidity
address owner
```

Owner of contract and eventual receiver of crowd funding

### onlyOwner

```solidity
modifier onlyOwner()
```

### SendingFailed

```solidity
error SendingFailed(address to)
```

Failed when sending ETH to `to` address.

### constructor

```solidity
constructor() public
```

Set the owner of the contract on deployment.

### fund

```solidity
function fund() public payable
```

Send ETH to crowdfund project.

### refundAll

```solidity
function refundAll() public
```

Owner can refund all funders.

### totalFunds

```solidity
function totalFunds() public view returns (uint256)
```

Calculate and return the total amount of funds raised.

## CrowdFundingDoSAttacker

The attacker is able to deny any refunds and as such keep the funds hostage.

### target

```solidity
contract CrowdFunding target
```

An interface to the target that will allow us to call its functions.

### constructor

```solidity
constructor(address _target) public
```

Set the target on deployment because we need it in storage
to be able to call it from the receive function.

### fund

```solidity
function fund() public payable
```

Fund the target contract with the value sent together with this transaction.

### receive

```solidity
receive() external payable
```

This is called when the target contract sends ETH to this contract.
Whenever the crowd funding contract tries to refund all, we will revert the transaction
and thus prevent everyone from being refunded.
