# Solidity API

## SimpleAuction

### currentLeader

```solidity
address currentLeader
```

address of the current leader of the auction

### highestBid

```solidity
uint256 highestBid
```

highest bid so far

### bid

```solidity
function bid() public payable
```

Bid on the auction with the value sent together with this transaction.
The old auction leader will receive his ETH back.

## AuctionDoSAttacker

### target

```solidity
contract SimpleAuction target
```

An interface to the target that will allow us to call its functions.

### constructor

```solidity
constructor(address _target) public
```

Set the target on deployment because we need it in storage
to be able to call it from the receive function.

### bid

```solidity
function bid() public payable
```

Bid on the auction with the value sent together with this transaction.
This contract will be the new auction leader if the transaction is successful.

### receive

```solidity
receive() external payable
```

This is called when the target contract sends ETH to this contract.
Whenever the auction tries to refund us, we will revert the transaction
and thus prevent any new bids from being made.
